Be sure to setup a mysql database named "tetris", add a user named "student" with the password "hello", and run the testrisInitial.sql on the new tetris database. 
(yes i spelled tetrisInitial wrong... no i am not going to change it)

The database will automatically run at localhost when you run the ServerGUI class.
